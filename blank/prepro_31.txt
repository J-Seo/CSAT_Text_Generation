sydney , australia â€” thousands of australians have taken to the streets this week to protest the police killing of an aboriginal teenager in a remote community , a case that has added fuel to long-simmering anger over the government 's behavior toward the country 's indigenous people .
on wednesday , the police officer who fatally shot the ##-year-old man , kumanjayi walker , in the central australian town of yuendumu was charged with murder .
but questions have continued to swirl about what happened when officers were alone with mr walker , as well as how he and his family were treated in the hours that followed .
mr walker did not receive medical care after he was shot on saturday , because staff had evacuated the clinic in yuendumu earlier in the day over safety concerns .
that left any medical emergencies to be handled by another clinic nearly ## miles away .
and after mr walker died , family members who waited outside a police station were not informed about his death until ## hours later .
