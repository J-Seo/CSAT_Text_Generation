african-americans benefited regardless of fish intake , showing a ## percent lower risk of heart attack .
this could be a chance finding , said dr joann manson , a director of the study and the chief of the division of preventive medicine at brigham and women 's hospital .
we do plan to pursue it in greater detail and try to replicate it in a separate trial because if this can be reproduced , that would be a very dramatic benefit to african-americans .
because there is still more research to be done , experts don’t necessarily recommended that african-americans take omega-# .
if you have some history of heart disease or high triglycerides ( an estimated ## percent of adults in the united states do , according to data from the national health and nutrition examination survey in #### ) , it may be a good idea to take omega-# .
the potential downside , because supplements are not regulated , is that production isn’t standardized so we don’t know what 's in them , according to dr pieter cohen , of cambridge health alliance , who is an associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school .
he said that supplements are expensive and that money could alternatively be spent on a healthier diet .
as an internist , dr cohen has seen negative behavioral effects in some of his patients who take supplements .
i have many patients who are like , ‘i’ll take my supplement and then i won’t worry about eating healthfully during the day ,’ dr cohen said .
that 's really misguided .
because in this case we have absolutely no evidence that replacing a healthy meal of fish with an omega-# supplement is better .
