youtube had taken additional steps to make it difficult to search for the name , removing an autocomplete feature that filled in the name once a person began typing it .
on tuesday morning , the top three videos claiming to share the whistle-blower 's name each had over ### ,### views .
instead , they shared it in the comments and discussions below the video , where people also linked to blogs discussing the identity .
many videos with the name were taken down after the new york times asked youtube about them .
facebook was unwilling to comment on whether it was seeing a coordinated effort to spread the whistle-blower 's name , but said it would continue to take down content that violated its policies .
youtube did not respond to a request for comment on the videos being shared on its site .
on instagram , photographs purporting to show the whistle-blower with a number of public figures from the democratic party were also widely shared .
earlier in the week , instagram had blocked searches for the last name being circulated , or for the hashtag #whistle-blower .
but on thursday , it was possible to search on that hashtag , as well as the purported full name or variations of the name .
instagram said it temporarily blocked searches for #whistle-blower while it calibrated its systems to ensure that legitimate searches for the term , or the purported name , were not being affected .
a twitter spokeswoman said posting names and images did not violate twitter rules .
she said twitter bans only specific types of private information , such as sharing a person 's home address , private phone number or government identification without their consent .
president trump , and his supporters , have called for the name of the whistle-blower to be made public .
on wednesday , during the house 's first public hearing in its impeachment inquiry , republican members of congress repeated calls for the whistle-blower to be identified .
