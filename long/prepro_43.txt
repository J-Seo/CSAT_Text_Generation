a group of researchers at washington state university published a study in communications biology in september that sought to better understand what goes on in the cells of hibernating grizzly bears .
the university is home to the wsu bear center , the only grizzly bear research center in the united states; it houses ## bears that were either raised in captivity or relocated to the center after being identified as problem bears in the wild .
researchers took samples from the liver , fat and muscle of six captive grizzly bears at three times during the year .
in the lab , a team of researchers analyzed the dna to understand the changes that occur in the cells over the course of the year .
the effect of hibernation on each tissue is different , said joanna kelley , an evolutionary biologist at washington state university and one of the paper 's authors .
hibernation is not just as simple as hibernating and not hibernating .
there are transitional things happening throughout the year .
the team found that the bears’ fatty tissues changed the most during hibernation , whereas the muscle tissue hardly changed at all .
the muscle cells remained active through the hibernation period , which might help explain why those tissues do not atrophy .
most surprising to heiko jansen , the study 's lead author , was that the bears’ fat contained a large number of genes that change their level of expression over the course of the year  .
it 's in the thousands , he said .
in contrast , when dwarf lemurs in madagascar hibernate , only a few hundred genes in their fat tissues change their level of expression seasonally .
