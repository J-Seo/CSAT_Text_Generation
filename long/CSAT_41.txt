Ms. Warren offered her transition plan two weeks after she released a detailed proposal to finance a Medicare for all system, at a cost of $20.5 trillion in additional federal spending over a decade.
Ms. Warren put forward that plan to rebut incessant questions about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class in order to fund a sweeping new government health insurance program.
To fund a full-scale Medicare for all program, Ms. Warren would rely on big tax increases on businesses and wealthy Americans, and she said that she would not increase taxes on middle-class families by “one penny.” Her plan was met with harsh criticism from Mr. Biden, whose campaign said it was “unrealistic” and required “mathematical gymnastics.”
Her transition plan did not come with its own detailed financing proposal, but it would cost the federal government less than an eventual Medicare for all system, over all, and would be funded using some mix of the revenue sources she has already identified, according to her plan.
When she released her financing proposal, Ms. Warren said she would release details at a later date regarding the transition to Medicare for all.
With her announcement on Friday, less than a week before the next Democratic debate, she is not only fleshing out her vision for the future of America’s health care system under a Warren administration, but strongly suggesting it will be among her top priorities.
Ms. Warren’s plan also spells out a long list of administrative actions she would take to change the health care system, even if Democrats do not retake the Senate.
She would roll back many Trump administration regulations that have weakened the Affordable Care Act and shore up benefits in the existing Medicare program.
She would also use executive authority to allow new generic versions of expensive drugs, such as insulins taken by patients with diabetes, treatments for hepatitis C, and the overdose reversal drug Naloxone, an effort to lower their prices.
