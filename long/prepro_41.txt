ms warren offered her transition plan two weeks after she released a detailed proposal to finance a medicare for all system , at a cost of $### trillion in additional federal spending over a decade .
ms warren put forward that plan to rebut incessant questions about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class in order to fund a sweeping new government health insurance program .
to fund a full-scale medicare for all program , ms warren would rely on big tax increases on businesses and wealthy americans , and she said that she would not increase taxes on middle-class families by one penny her plan was met with harsh criticism from mr biden , whose campaign said it was unrealistic and required mathematical gymnastics .
her transition plan did not come with its own detailed financing proposal , but it would cost the federal government less than an eventual medicare for all system , over all , and would be funded using some mix of the revenue sources she has already identified , according to her plan .
when she released her financing proposal , ms warren said she would release details at a later date regarding the transition to medicare for all .
with her announcement on friday , less than a week before the next democratic debate , she is not only fleshing out her vision for the future of america 's health care system under a warren administration , but strongly suggesting it will be among her top priorities .
ms warren 's plan also spells out a long list of administrative actions she would take to change the health care system , even if democrats do not retake the senate .
she would roll back many trump administration regulations that have weakened the affordable care act and shore up benefits in the existing medicare program .
she would also use executive authority to allow new generic versions of expensive drugs , such as insulins taken by patients with diabetes , treatments for hepatitis c , and the overdose reversal drug naloxone , an effort to lower their prices .
