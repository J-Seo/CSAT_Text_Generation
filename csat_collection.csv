With the pedal-assist, which usually can be adjusted up or down to suit someone’s fitness and preferences, they make hills feel flatter and distances shorter. The extra boost may encourage people who are out of shape, inexperienced or entering or exiting middle age to cycle. A few small past studies have found that riding a road e-bike also constitutes hearty exercise. In a small 2016 study in Boulder, Colo., researchers found that commuting on an e-bike for a month increased new riders’ fitness and improved their blood-sugar control. Most of the volunteers also accumulated more time in the saddle than had been asked of them for the study, presumably because they were enjoying themselves. But little has been known about whether e-mountain bikes likewise provide a robust workout or whether riders will like them. So, for the new study, which was published in August in JMIR Formative Research, researchers at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, determined to find out. They began by recruiting experienced local mountain bikers, in part because, should these riders work up a sweat on an e-mountain bike, newcomers to the sport would likewise be expected to get a meaningful workout. The researchers also were interested in the riders’ attitudes toward pedal-assisted mountain biking and whether the riders felt that e-bikes might make the activity somehow too easy. They wound up with 33 riders, mostly men, from age 18 to 65, all of whom turned up on separate days at the trailhead for a rolling, six-mile, single-track loop. There, they completed several questionnaires about their beliefs about e-bikes, strapped on a heart rate monitor and activity-tracking watch and rode the trail astride either a standard mountain bike or a comparable e-version. After a rest, they repeated the loop on whichever bike they had not ridden before. At the end, they filled out the questionnaires again.",① Lesotho mountain prime minister 's allure is hot.,② Mountain loop repeated in beijing.,③ More people encouraged to enter middle age.,④ Volunteers of found in saddle.,"⑤ As a mountain biking motivator, add a little electronic assist.",

We had access to a huge data set — millions and millions of real estate transactions — that showed how investors had come to dominate the market for starter homes in many cities. But what really made the story come to life was when we zoomed in on one house that had changed hands several times and got to talk to all the people who had touched it — the investor who flipped it, the family that bought it, the would-be buyer who kept losing out to investors. At the end of the day, data isn’t the story; people are the story. But I assume you aren’t doing all that data analysis on your phone. I do most of my data analysis in a statistical programming language called R. It lets me work with data sets that have hundreds of thousands or even millions of rows, much too large for a spreadsheet program like Excel. It also makes it easy to automate tasks that I perform regularly — so when the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report comes out, for example, I can download the new data and update my analysis with just a few keystrokes.

Here are some questions to consider. Pick a Winner For starters, analysts say, investors should ask whether the underlying industry is growing. But even in growth areas, not every franchise is a winner. Franchising, like the economy, is cyclical. Data shows that the top growth areas for franchising include fitness centers, children’s educational programs and the general health sector; food, as a broad category, is ebbing. Potential buyers should look carefully at federal disclosure forms that are required for franchises, paying particular attention to Item 19, which addresses the return on investment and the unit economics, said Jeff Johnson , founder and chief executive of the Franchise Research Institute. The second big factor is whether branding will matter. Darrell Johnson of FRANdata said most people know their primary physician’s name but probably not the name of the doctor’s medical practice. Yet in an emergency, people are highly unlikely to ask for a doctor by name, relying instead on the reputation of the hospital or ambulatory care center. Branding counts in some franchise areas, too, like home health services. “Senior care is one sector where branding matters,” he said. “It’s hard to arrange something if I’m six states away. But there could be a consistency and expectation around a certain type of senior care.” Do you have a winning idea of your own? A better opportunity to create wealth may be to become the franchiser by setting up a business that creates and manages your concept and collects fees from licensing and revenue.","

For the past year, Matt’s been talking to health experts to find out if we are reaching the end of the antibiotic era. Is our fate sealed?” “First off, I don’t think people respect bacteria enough.” This is Ellen Silbergeld, one of the leading scientists studying antibiotic resistance. No.” “The C.D.C. got our attention today with a warning about what it calls ‘nightmare bacteria.’” “These are bacteria that are resistant to most, if not all, antibiotics.” When we take antibiotics to kill infections, some bacteria survive. So every time we take an antibiotic, we risk creating stronger, more resistant bacteria. And stronger, more resistant bacteria means less and less effective antibiotics. “Drug-resistant bacteria have never been able to travel the world as fast as they do today.” And that’s just part of the problem. “You should know that about 80 percent of antibiotic production in this country goes into agriculture.” “Why on earth did somebody think putting antibiotics in agriculture was a great idea?” “We’ve said, hey, look, cram these animals together. And you can make money off of that.” “Nobody was making the connection between feeding animals antibiotics and the fact that the food would be carrying drug-resistant bacteria.” So Ellen did a study. And she found that poultry raised with antibiotics had nine times as much drug-resistant bacteria on it. Organic agriculture lauds the use of animal manure.” “Unless you’re just a complete, ‘I’m a vegan, and I only hang out with vegans, and I eat sterilized vegetables,’ you know, it’s very likely that you’re picking up the same bacteria.” Resistant bacteria seep into the groundwater, fly off the back of livestock trucks and hitch a ride home on the hands of farm workers, all of which makes trying to pinpoint exactly where resistant bacteria is originating extremely difficult.

It has ignored turkers’ pleas to mandate higher wages, even as it takes a cut of each transaction ranging from 17 to 50 percent; a requester posting a 1-cent HIT pays one penny to the turker and another to Amazon. While Amazon pays all of its American employees at least $15 an hour and favors raising the minimum wage, the company declined numerous requests to comment about the pay policy for turkers or anything else regarding Mechanical Turk.

To fund a full-scale Medicare for all program, Ms. Warren would rely on big tax increases on businesses and wealthy Americans, and she said that she would not increase taxes on middle-class families by “one penny.” Her plan was met with harsh criticism from Mr. Biden, whose campaign said it was “unrealistic” and required “mathematical gymnastics.” Her transition plan did not come with its own detailed financing proposal, but it would cost the federal government less than an eventual Medicare for all system, over all, and would be funded using some mix of the revenue sources she has already identified, according to her plan. When she released her financing proposal, Ms. Warren said she would release details at a later date regarding the transition to Medicare for all. With her announcement on Friday, less than a week before the next Democratic debate, she is not only fleshing out her vision for the future of America’s health care system under a Warren administration, but strongly suggesting it will be among her top priorities. Ms. Warren’s plan also spells out a long list of administrative actions she would take to change the health care system, even if Democrats do not retake the Senate. She would roll back many Trump administration regulations that have weakened the Affordable Care Act and shore up benefits in the existing Medicare program. She would also use executive authority to allow new generic versions of expensive drugs, such as insulins taken by patients with diabetes, treatments for hepatitis C, and the overdose reversal drug Naloxone, an effort to lower their prices.",① Ms Warren Retreats Details On Medicare,② Democratic Plan To Change Health Care System.,③ Warren Vows To Expand Health Coverage In First 100 Days.,④ Plan To Lower Prices Of Generic Drugs.,⑤ Ms Warren Puts Taxes On Middle Class.,
