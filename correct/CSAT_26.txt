Shortly after pitcher Jacob deGrom signed a contract extension worth $137.5 million with the Mets on the eve of opening day in March, his father, Tony, waited for him inside the Diplomat Room off the lobby at the Ritz-Carlton in Arlington, Va.
Tony deGrom considered his son’s accomplishments a day before he would start the Mets’ opener : rookie of the year in 2014, World Series runner-up in 2015 and the 2018 Cy Young Award winner.
The elder deGrom believed his son’s most recent accomplishment would not be his peak.
“I think he’s capable of winning a few more Cy Youngs,” Tony deGrom said.
“If you look at his history, he has a lot less wear on him than most guys his age, so I think he’s capable of winning a few more.’’
The father proved prophetic Wednesday night.
Jacob deGrom, who battled through a tough stretch in April and overcame what Manager Mickey Callaway called a “barking” elbow, won the National League Cy Young Award and became the 11th pitcher to claim the prize in consecutive years.
