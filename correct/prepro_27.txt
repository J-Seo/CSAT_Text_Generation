if you’re going to fly for nearly ## hours through multiple time zones dressed in a pair of kangaroo-themed pajamas , jolting in and out of sleep in contravention of your normal circadian rhythm , you should take it easy on the medication .
no one wants to go crazy in a metal tube ## ,### feet above the pacific .
on the other hand , suspecting that you have fallen into a rift in the space-time continuum itself is perhaps as reasonable a response as any to the longest (so far) commercial flight in the world .
so there i was last month , six or so hours into qantas 's first-ever nonstop flight from new york city to sydney .
it was # am new york time , which made it no o’clock in the tiny upscale refugee camp created by the airline .
i had been suffering from congestion , the kind that migrates around your sinuses and then becomes an infection in your ear .
while i was no longer contagious , there was some issue about the future of my ability to hear .
the internet did not have good news .
flying with an ear infection doesn’t always result in a ruptured eardrum , one website said .
basically , i had been taking decongestants since midafternoon .
i felt like a junkie in a gritty tv show about times square in the ####s , nervous and sweaty and incoherent even as i was beset by an achy , leaden inertia .
soon the lights would go down , part of the airline 's next planned group activity (sleeping) and i would make perhaps the gravest pharmaceutical error of my adult life .
but that was still in the future .
