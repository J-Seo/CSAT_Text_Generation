many of these translators got involved because they noticed incorrect or incomplete english transcripts online , but also because they saw an opportunity to participate in the rise of a group they wanted to see succeed .
at the first bts concert the ##-something fan jiye kim (who posts as @doyou_bangtan) attended , she saw the band wanted the concert to be a way for us to share in our joys and pain , just as humans walking alongside each other , she said in a phone interview  .
bangtan translations is one of the largest , posting comprehensive , authoritative interpretations of lyrics , tweets and long videos .
the six-person peachboy team does social media posts , lyrics and letters from the subscription-based fancafe platform .
for in-depth looks at lyrics , @doolsetbangtan and @doyou_bangtan offer heavily contextualized , almost academic deep dives .
translating for one of k-pop 's biggest groups comes with pressures .
the sheer amount of content requires some discernment , even as a growing english-speaking market demands more , and wants it faster .
some translators have experienced burnout , especially those working alone at the mercy of an incredibly active and devoted fan base .
the person behind the popular account @cafe_army shared a letter to followers on june ## announcing an indefinite rest to focus on their personal life , which had been compromised by so much time translating .
others can relate: kim averages more than a thousand phone notifications a day .
katie h , who runs @doolsetbangtan , took a short break last year after realizing she felt guilty when she didn’t have time to translate everything .
people think we’re machines , said rachel , whose korean name is yejin , about her work helping run @spotlightbts as a busy ##-year-old college student in the united states .
she said twitter fans will tell her , i don’t know how you balance your life with all of this .
