dear tess - .
 .
i write these few lines hoping they will find you well , as they leave me at present , thank god for it  .
dear tess , we are all glad to hear that you are going really to be married soon  .
but with respect to your question , tess , j say between ourselves , quite private but very strong , that on no account do you say a word of your bygone trouble to him  .
i did not tell everything to your father , he being so proud on account of his respectability , which , perhaps , your intended is the same .
many a woman—some of the highest in the land—have had a trouble in their time; and why should you trumpet yours when others don’t trumpet theirs?  .
no girl would be such a fool , specially as it is so long ago , and not your fault at all .
i shall answer the same if you ask me fifty times .
besides , you must bear in mind that , knowing it to be your childish nature to tell all that 's in your heart—so simple!—j made you promise me never to let it out by word or deed , having your welfare in my mind; and you most solemnly did promise it ### tess of the d’urbervilles going from this door  .
i have not named either that question or your coming marriage to your father , as he would blab it everywhere , poor simple man .
