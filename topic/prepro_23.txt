if someone is inclined to buy a franchise , whether for the independence or the wealth , a cleareyed view of what is being pitched is important .
here are some questions to consider .
pick a winner .
for starters , analysts say , investors should ask whether the underlying industry is growing .
but even in growth areas , not every franchise is a winner .
franchising , like the economy , is cyclical .
data shows that the top growth areas for franchising include fitness centers , children 's educational programs and the general health sector; food , as a broad category , is ebbing .
potential buyers should look carefully at federal disclosure forms that are required for franchises , paying particular attention to item ## , which addresses the return on investment and the unit economics , said jeff johnson  , founder and chief executive of the franchise research institute .
the second big factor is whether branding will matter .
darrell johnson of frandata said most people know their primary physician 's name but probably not the name of the doctor 's medical practice .
yet in an emergency , people are highly unlikely to ask for a doctor by name , relying instead on the reputation of the hospital or ambulatory care center .
branding counts in some franchise areas , too , like home health services .
senior care is one sector where branding matters , he said .
it 's hard to arrange something if iâ€™m six states away .
but there could be a consistency and expectation around a certain type of senior care .
do you have a winning idea of your own? .
a better opportunity to create wealth may be to become the franchiser by setting up a business that creates and manages your concept and collects fees from licensing and revenue .
