when arianna varuolo-clarke was growing up , her favorite evenings were spent watching the weather channel with her grandfather .
she wanted to chase thunderstorms and understand where tornadoes came from , she said .
she decided to become an atmospheric scientist .
in #### , she landed an internship at the national center for atmospheric research as a college sophomore , and quickly realized that her path as a woman of color would not be easy .
you’d walk through the halls and it 's a lot of old white men , ms varuolo-clarke said .
still , she pushed forward and began her phd in atmospheric science at columbia university last year .
the field 's lack of diversity gained new urgency in may when her graduate student cohort was targeted with a series of racist emails .
the messages , sent to affiliates of the lamont-doherty earth observatory at columbia by a person outside the community , said that black people were genetically inferior and did not belong in academia .
it was hurtful and invalidating to be told that she didn’t belong in the world that had drawn her in since childhood , ms varuolo-clarke said .
it was an isolated incident .
but it brought to the surface what still needs to be done in the field .
in a commentary last week in nature geoscience , kuheli dutt , lamont-doherty 's assistant director for academic affairs and diversity , wrote that a lack of diversity and inclusion is the single largest cultural problem facing the geosciences today .
