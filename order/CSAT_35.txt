People who’ve spoken to Mr. Patrick say he sees an opportunity in the flagging poll numbers of Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, the two major black candidates already in the race.
If he can do decently well in early-voting New Hampshire, his neighboring state, he may gain support in South Carolina, where the majority of the primary electorate is black, the thinking goes.
The obstacles to this plan are obvious: money and manpower.
Having been out of public life for nearly five years, Mr. Patrick has no list of donors to tap.
And, at such a late date, he’s scrambling to assemble a team, pulling in former staff members of Beto O’Rourke.
Money isn’t a problem for Mr. Bloomberg, whose net worth is estimated to be more than $52 billion.
But the first Iowa poll to include Mr. Bloomberg since news broke of his possible bid shows him with a negative 31 percent approval rating, making him the least popular candidate in the field.
In New Hampshire, 54 percent of likely primary voters already say they would definitely not vote for him.
Those low numbers along with the shrinking calendar are the reasons Mr. Bloomberg is said to be considering an untraditional strategy of skipping the first four nominating states.
He’d then carpet-bomb the more expensive media markets of the Super Tuesday contests with television advertising — the main way to reach voters in vast states like California and Texas that vote March 3.
It’s a theory that has been attempted in more modest ways by other candidates — Rudy Giuliani in 2008 and Jerry Brown in 1976 — and met with failure.
Success in the early-voting states offers proof that a candidate can do what Democrats, particularly in this election, want most of all: to win.
Wait until March to make that case, and you might be too late.
Money matters in politics.
But so does momentum.
